# Laboratory work №2
### Calculation method - rectangle method
#### Available equations to integrate:
* 1 / sqrt(x)
* 8x + x^2 - x^3/3
* 2x -10
* sin(x)/(cos(x)^2 + 1
* e^2x  

Сalculations occur with user-defined accuracy.  
The error is calculated by the Runge method.  
P.S. Rectangle method has a so small accuracy, so that method useless if you want to get a correct result
